CMPT 315 Assignment #3

Unable to complete the assignment as per lab specs. Encountered an issue: when clicking on the email sidebar, it should display in the email body view, but it pops down and appears within the email sidebar view. Attempted to resolve using global variables to send the message to the email body view component, but couldn't figure it out within the given time constraints.

BONUS question completed: filter search by Email's subject
